 Keylime is an open source scalable trust system harnessing TPM Technology.
 .
 Keylime provides an end-to-end solution for bootstrapping hardware rooted
 cryptographic trust for remote machines, the provisioning of encrypted payloads
 and run-time system integrity monitoring. It also provides a flexible
 framework for the remote attestation of any given `PCR` (Platform Configuration
 Register). Users can create their own customized actions that will trigger when
 a machine fails its attested measurements.
 .
 Keylime's mission is to make TPM Technology easily accessible to developers and
 users alike, without the need for a deep understanding of the lower levels of a
 TPM's operations. Amongst many scenarios, it well suited to tenants who need to
 remotely attest machines not under their own full control (such as a consumer of
